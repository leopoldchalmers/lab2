1. 
    • gas() - contract 

Vehicle:

Updates the current speed of the instance object based on amount.

The input (amount) must be a double from 0 to 1.

Calls method "incrementSpeed" with amount as argument which increases the currentSpeed

Updates instance variable isStationary to false


Volvo:
Same as for Vehicle

Scania:
Same as for Vehicle, but checks if ramp islowered before running gas()


    • brake() - contract

Updates the current speed of the instance object based on amount.

The input (amount) must be a double from 0 to 1.

Calls method "decrementSpeed" with amount as argument which decreases the currentSpeed.

Updates instance variable to True if currentSpeed is 0.
 

    • The implementation of brake() is not overwritten and therefore fulfills the contract.

    • The implementation of gas() however is overwritten in Scania. Nonetheless, the contract is still fulfilled,
      since the implementation does the same thing, but only when we want it to based on an if-statement.

    • The Liskov substitution principle is followed since we can replace object of Vehicle with objects of Scania and Volvo without breaking the application.
      This is possible because the method are inherited and not overwritten, exception for Scania's gas method, which still fulfills the contract.

    • Check UML-diagram.png for overview of the structure.

    • The only delegation we used was from CarTransporter and CarRepairShop to the CarManagement class.
      We did this because the methods in CarManagement are used in both CarTransporter and CarRepairShop.
      We didn't use an interface because the implementation is always the same and we didn't use subclassing
      because CarManagement and CarRepairShop exist outside Vehicle hierarchy.

    • We used subclassing for the vehicle hierarchy because all the other relevant classes have the same functionality.

    • No code was rewritten, only rearanged into a new hierarchy. Essentially we moved the majority of the code in Car to a new superclass Vehicle.
     
    • Check Lab_1_overview.png for overview of the lab 1 structure.

    • Since we were able to extend our code without modifying it, we have followed the open-closed principle!
